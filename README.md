# Ocean v2

TODO: Add screenshots.

# Requirements

- [i3-gaps-next](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) (not sure if the "next" branch is required but I use it)
- [i3blocks-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3blocks-gaps) (which works better with the i3bar added by i3-gaps-next)
- terminal emulator with 256 colors and Unicode support
- compton

As for the terminal, I use termite because it's so much easier to configure than urxvt and
does everything I need out-of-the-box, where urxvt needs like 30 plugins.

## Other software you may want

...because I include configs and scripts for them:

- dunst
- i3lock
- vim
- mpd + ncmpcpp

I'd also like to mention that I'm currently using xfce4-power-manager. That's because my laptop
uses some arcane technology which makes the screen brightness buttons very difficult to work
with, but Xfce's power manager can do it somehow.

- Airblader - author of i3-gaps, and I stole some parts of his configs.
- emkay443 - helped with some scripts (I can't bash).

# TODO

In order of significance:

- switch to polybar
- rice zathura
- fix the horribly kludged ncmpcpp config (it works but oh my *god* is it ugly)
